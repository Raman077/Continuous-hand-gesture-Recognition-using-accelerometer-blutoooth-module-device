# Continuous-hand-gesture-Recognition-using-accelerometer-blutoooth-module-device
Iot based smart device using acceleromter,gyroscopic sensor for continuous hand gesture to implement a gesture keyboard.Data set was collected manually by drawing hand gesture and the recording was observed. SVM  algorithm was used later on used to classify the gesture.
